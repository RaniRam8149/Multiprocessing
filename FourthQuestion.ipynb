Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?
A multiprocessing pool in Python refers to a group of worker processes that are created to perform parallel execution of tasks. It's a part of the multiprocessing module and is particularly useful for distributing tasks across multiple processes and utilizing all available CPU cores efficiently.
The multiprocessing pool is used for several reasons:

Efficient Utilization of Resources: By distributing tasks among multiple worker processes, multiprocessing pools enable efficient utilization of available CPU cores, leading to faster execution of tasks, especially for CPU-bound operations.

Scalability: Multiprocessing pools scale well with the number of available CPU cores. As the number of cores increases, the pool can accommodate more worker processes, further improving performance.

Isolation: Each worker process in the pool operates independently, with its own memory space. This isolation prevents issues like data corruption and unintended side effects, improving the overall robustness of the system.

Convenient API: Multiprocessing pools provide a convenient and high-level API for parallel execution, making it easier for developers to parallelize their code without dealing with low-level details of process creation and management.
